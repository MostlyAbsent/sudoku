### validators

- [x] I need to add on onchange validator to restrict input to digits. 
- [ ] It should reset to the previous value if it fails validation.
  - This isn't resetting yet. I think it's a state mangement issue.
  
### Jotai

I think if i refactor to jotai and having button inputs for the value entry this will work better. This might even extend to on-keypress or something.
